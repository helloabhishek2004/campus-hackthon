# Current Status — Smart Campus Project

## Monorepo & Base Infrastructure

Status: **Completed & Ready**

- pnpm workspaces initialized (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `modules/*`).
- Root scripts configured (`dev`, `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `format`).
- Shared packages implemented (`@smart-campus/contracts`, `@smart-campus/ui`, `@smart-campus/utils`, `@smart-campus/config`).
- Supabase migrations configured (`001_initial_schema.sql`).
- Deterministic mock AI pipeline configured.

## Module 1 — Campus Information & Communication System

Status: **Foundation Complete, Ready for Feature Implementation**

- Next.js 15 App Router structure created.
- Live test harness and integration route (`/api/complaints/analyze`) operational.
- Supabase SSR client helpers configured.
- Pending:
  - Auth flow (login / registration) UI integration.
  - Personalized campus announcement feed.
  - Officer triage dashboard views.

## Module 2 — Complaint Intelligence Processing

Status: **Core Pipeline Complete & Tested**

- Input validation with Zod schemas.
- Heuristic fallback & mock generation for offline development.
- Google Gemini SDK (`@google/genai`) integration with schema enforcement.
- Jaccard similarity and duplicate issue cluster matching.
- Unit tests written and passing for validation, classification, and clustering.

## Integration

Status: **Initial Contract Integration Operational**

- Module 1 calls `analyzeComplaint(request)` through Next.js server route handler.
- Requests and responses conform strictly to `@smart-campus/contracts`.

### Module 3 — Lost & Found

Status: **Integrated Hackathon System; browser acceptance pending**

- Session-derived identity replaced hardcoded UI identity assumptions.
- Item detail and match detail use server-derived capability flags.
- My Reports is session-scoped and includes both lost and found reports across
  lifecycle states.
- Claim answers are submitted through the existing API and validated before
  approval.
- Finder/staff decisions preserve authorization and state conflict behavior.
- Approved claimants can confirm handover; linked reports become resolved.
- Contact UX remains truthful and Campus Security-mediated when no direct contact
  source is available.
- Processing UX uses bounded cancellable polling for both report types.
- Public projections remain free of ownership IDs and private item data.

### AI/runtime

- FastAPI AI service is running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in deterministic
  mock mode and has passed health/analyze smoke checks.
- The web app is running at `http://localhost:3000` and has passed login and mock
  authentication API checks.
- Hosted Supabase remains the active data authority for the current web environment.
- Docker and the Supabase CLI are installed. Local Supabase requires the refreshed
  shell to recognize the user's Docker group before `supabase start` can run.
- The normal hosted web path uses the inline queue in `apps/web/lib/queue.ts`; the
  separate pg-boss worker is optional for this setup.

### Verification

- Full monorepo tests: **276 passing**.
- Lost & Found module tests: **31 passing**.
- AI service tests: **2 passing**.
- Lost & Found and worker typechecks: passing.
- Prior full web build/typecheck/lint and diff checks: passing; lint has existing
  warnings but no errors.
- Full multi-user browser E2E remains unverified because browser sign-in/tab
  handoff was not completed.
